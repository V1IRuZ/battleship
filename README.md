# Battleship

This project is a Battleship game built using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and comprehensive unit testing.

The game includes two modes: Player vs Computer and Player vs Player.

Ships can be placed randomly or manually by dragging them onto the board. Their orientation can be changed by double-clicking a ship.
